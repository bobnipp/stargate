## Map of the World
We are utilizing a beta version of Map of the World for our mapping functionality. This version
of the API requires permission to use. Any user of our application will need to have a 
certificate installed on their machine that their browser will provide to the Map of the 
World API.

This is an essential step for enabling our acceptance tests around mapping. Create a file called `com.google.Chrome.plist`
in the `/Library/Preferences` directory and add the following contents:
```
<plist version="1.0â€³>
<dict>
  <key>AutoSelectCertificateForUrls</key>
   <array>
     <string>{"pattern":"[*.]gxiaccess.gxaccess.com[*.}","filter":{"ISSUER":{"CN":"GX Test Root CA"}}}</string>
   </array>
</dict>
</plist>
```

#### Useful documentation
